So for my final project I'm creating a website for the liquor store around the corner. I figure I can help out a local business,
learn how to make a website from scratch with my new tools from CS50, familiarize myself with github, and submit said project!

First things first, I'm going to figure out how to import cool themes. No need to reinvent the wheel, as they say ;)
